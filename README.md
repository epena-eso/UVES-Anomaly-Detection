# UVES-Anomaly-Detection

Paranal machine learning Azure proof of concept: UVES, Anomaly Detection

This is a Proof of Concepts (PoC) of using Machine Laerning (ML) and Azure cloud services in the operation of Paranal observatory. This project is not about analizing scientific data but calibartion images in order to automativally detect anomalies in the instrument. The PoC include two (2) components:

1. Machine leaerning techniques, particularly image processing algorithms applied to astronomical instruments calibration fits files (particularlu UVES bias,flats and arcs)
2. The usage of cloud services, particularly MS Azure
